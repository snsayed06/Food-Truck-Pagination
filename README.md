# Getting Started with Create React App

# Description/Write-up

It's a React Application created using CRA(create react app) which display the list of food truck open at the current date and in the city of San Francisco. The data has been acquired from an open-source API 'http://data.sfgov.org/resource/bbb8-hzi6.json'. To populate the data in the app, Axios library has been used in an async/await way so that it does not create an issue if it takes a while to load the content since JavaScript is a single thread language. Once the data has been retrieved with the help of a helper function, we filter the result according to the week of the date as well as the time which will give the results of open food trucks followed by sorting the data Alphabetically. We will be setting up few conditions such as initial page and a number of list to be displayed on UI in the beginning of the component, with help of those values we can calculate and findout which list to be displayed. Since there is a huge amount of data, so we will make of use Pagination which help us to find when the user clicks on number, and according to that the result should populate on the UI. For styling purpose, I have used CSS3 and its features such as Flex

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

npm install

### `npm start`

npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
